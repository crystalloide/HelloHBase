# Java API code to interact with HBase

This is a sample HBase Java API program which will do the following:

1) Create an HBase table
2) Insert a row into an HBase table
3) Read the row from HBase table

I used a self managed cluster Hadoop 3.1.0 HA (High Avalilabilty) with Zookeeper HA and HBase HA version 2.5.6
